Radio Intro - from spark gaps to SDR
====================================

DC, AC.
Frequency and wavelength
DC to Daylight: Radio, Light, Xrays - all electromagnetic radiation.
Wikipedia page on propagation.
antennas
propagation and the ionosphere
modulation AM, FM, SSB, FSK, PSK, BPSK and their 'official' names
Radio receivers: crystal set, TRF, Regen, Superhet
SDR - simplify hardware (computers not simple) and use software.
Anatomy of an SDR dongle.
SDR demo via CubicSDR and/or ShinySDR.

WSPR radio
==========

Day 1- Explain Weak Signals with a light dusting of radio theory.
Inverse square law of propagation.
Demo of running WSPR software on linux.

Day 2 -  build and use a WSPR receiver.

Regen receivers
===============

Day 1 - Olde fashioned radio (AM or SSB) can be received several ways.
TRF: RF amp, detector, AF amp.
Superhet: Improve on TRF with staged amplification and 'untuned' amplification at IF.
Regen is an option: Take advantage of RF amp feedback to increase gain.
Demo regen.

Day 2 - Build and test a regen receiver.
